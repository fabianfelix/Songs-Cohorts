# Song-Cohorts

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Song Cohorts project! This data science and machine learning project focus on creating cohorts of songs for Spotify, a popular audio streaming service. The objective is to enhance the song recommendation system by analyzing various features and grouping similar songs into cohorts. This project aims to provide a more personalized and engaging music experience for Spotify's users.

## Problem Scenario
The customer always looks forward to specialized treatment, whether shopping over an e-commerce website or watching Netflix. They want what they might like to see. To keep the customers engaged, it is also crucial for companies to always present the most relevant information. Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media service provider. The company has over 456 million active monthly users, including over 195 million paying subscribers, as of September 2022. The company intends to create cohorts of different songs that will aid in the recommendation of songs to users based on various relevant features. Each cohort would contain similar types of songs.

## Problem Objective
As a data scientist, you should perform exploratory data analysis and perform cluster analysis to create cohorts of songs. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to creating a cohort of songs.
As a data scientist working on this project, your primary objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and perform cluster analysis to create cohorts of songs. The goal is to delve into the dataset, understand the various features that influence song categorization, and use clustering techniques to group songs with similar characteristics. These cohorts will then serve as the foundation for an improved recommendation system.

## Project Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate and understand the dataset, perform data cleaning, and explore the distribution of key features.

2. **Recommend Albums Based on Popular Songs:** Utilize visualizations to identify albums with the highest average popularity and recommend them based on the number of popular songs.

3. **Cluster Analysis:** Apply clustering algorithms to group songs into cohorts based on relevant features. Determine the optimal number of clusters, choose an appropriate clustering algorithm, and define each cluster based on the features.
